I Build this E-commerce RESTful API and created a database that collects customer information details and stores it in the database. After a successful submission, an alphanumeric 6-digit code was generated and returned to the customer. This code will be used to identify the customer in future transactions. The API contains endpoints for registering new customers, retrieving customer details, updating customer information, and generating the alphanumeric code. Most importantly, the API also support user authentication and authorization, handle errors appropriately, and have proper validation for user inputs.
